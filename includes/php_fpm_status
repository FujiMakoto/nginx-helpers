# PHP FPM Status
############################################
# This file contains a location block used for enabling admin only access to the php_fpm_status URI.
# The PHP-FPM status page contains a lot of useful profiling information for PHP applications, but it can contain
# sensitive data that should not be publicly accessible as well.
#
# Note: This location block assumes you have a php_backend upstream block defined for handling PHP-FPM requests.
#
# For more information, refer to the following article (since there's seemingly no official documentation)
# https://easyengine.io/tutorials/php/fpm-status-page/
